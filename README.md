<p>Neolang is an interpreted programming language created by filcher. This programming language is designed for the purpose of creating simple scripts. This programming language is similar in syntax to Python, C++ and JavaScript. The language is distributed under the <a href="https://github.com/filcherock/neolang/blob/main/LICENSE">MIT License</a></p>

*An example of a simple code in Elang that outputs Hello, world!*

```shell
print("Hello, world!")
```

*An example of code that asks the user for their name and displays it*

var name = ("What's u name?")
